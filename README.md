TypingSpeedGame – Java Swing Project

Description:
TypingSpeedGame is an interactive Java application built using Swing that helps users test and improve their typing speed. The game displays random sentences for the user to type and provides real-time feedback on typing accuracy and speed.

Key Features:

Random sentences: A new sentence appears each time the user clicks Start or requests a New Line.

Live feedback: Correctly typed letters turn green, mistakes turn red.

Timer and WPM display: Separate panels show elapsed time and typing speed (Words Per Minute) in real-time.

Dynamic WPM calculation: Typing speed updates live as the user types.

User-friendly GUI: Built with Java Swing for an interactive experience.

New Line Button: Users can skip unwanted sentences and practice with a fresh one instantly.

Technologies Used:

Java

Swing (JTextPane, JButton, JLabel, Timer)

StyledDocument for colored text feedback

Learning Outcomes:

Hands-on experience with Java Swing GUI development

Understanding event-driven programming with KeyListener and ActionListener

Implementing real-time calculations and dynamic updates in GUI

Working with randomization, arrays, and text processing in Java

Potential Enhancements:

Add scoreboard or history of WPM for multiple rounds

Include countdown timers for challenges

Integrate additional sentences or user-generated texts
